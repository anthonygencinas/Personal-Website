## The C Programming Language

Easily one of the more tough books to work with. I still recommend the book as it lays a basis for a
low level understanding of how memory allocation works. After going through the book and completeing a 
number of excercises in C, you will gain more of an appreciation for modern programming languages like
C++, Java, Kotlin, Javascript, Python, and many more.

## Reactive Design Patterns

One of many bibles for those who are interested in creating reactive API's (which should be all software
engineers at some point in their career).  

## Effective Java

For all Object-Oriented and especially Java Developers this books helps understand many best practices 
in an Object-Oriented Language.
